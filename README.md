# Canadian Currency Calculator 

During my initial foray into part-time work in Canada, I assumed the role of a Concierge. One of my primary responsibilities was to count the float and submit the tally to the manager at the conclusion of each shift. As a recent transplant to Canada, I found myself grappling with the challenges of both identifying the currency and efficiently tabulating the float.

Motivated by these experiences, I embarked on my inaugural independent project utilizing Next.js technology. The result was a simple yet effective [currency calculator app](https://canadian-currency-calculator.vercel.app), designed to streamline the process of counting the cash box float.

This project served as a pivotal learning experience, affording me the opportunity to grasp fundamental concepts within the context of a straightforward application and a real-world use case.
